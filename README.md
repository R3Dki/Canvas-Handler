# Canvas-Handler
A JS module that makes using Canvas API very easy.
It has a function( BeginHandler("ElementID") ) that sets up the Context with just the Canvas Element ID.
It can draw Pixels, Lines, Circles, Rectangles, Triangles, Polygons, Text and can Clear the Screen

I think i'll rewrite some of it's code later to make it more optimized.
